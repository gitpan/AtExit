 HISTORY
 =======
 04-Sep-1996           Brad Appleton     <Brad_Appleton-GDBA001@email.mot.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.02
 - Added the rmexit() function to unregister subroutines if desired.
 - Added $EXITING and $IGNORE_WHEN_EXITING variables to control behavior
   of atexit() during exit-processing.
 - Tested and documented the behavior of atexit() during exit-processing.

 02-Sep-1996           Brad Appleton     <Brad_Appleton-GDBA001@email.mot.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.01
 - Some minor changes to documentation and variable names at the request
   of some comp.lang.perl.modules readers.

 27-Aug-1996           Brad Appleton     <Brad_Appleton-GDBA001@email.mot.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.00 posted to comp.lang.perl.modules to garner feedback, and
 to see if the module was too trivial to merit placing on CPAN.
 - Added sections to the manpage as recommended by Andrew Langmead.
 - Convert "soft-refs" to subs into "hard-refs" at Andrew's recommendation.
 - Added exit-handler arguments to atexit() at Andrew's recommendation.
 - Changed atexit() to return a sub-ref (instead of nothing).

 26-Aug-1996           Brad Appleton     <Brad_Appleton-GDBA001@email.mot.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Polished up a bit for production and added documentation. Sent the result
 to Andrew Langmead for his comments and approval.
