 WHAT IS THIS?
 =============
 This is "AtExit", a Perl5 module which exports a function name "atexit()"
 to perform ANSI-C style exit processing for Perl5 programs; and a class
 named "AtExit" to register clean-up functions for any variable-scope in
 which the AtExit object is defined.

 HISTORY
 =======
 19-Jan-1999           Brad Appleton               <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 2.01
 - rmexit may now be called (as a function or a method) with *no* arguments.
   When this happens, *all* exit-handlers are removed!


 18-Oct-1998           Brad Appleton               <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 2.00
 Made the following changes based on patches contributed by Michael Chase
 - AtExit may now be used as a class to create objects which invoke callbacks
   whenever the AtExit object is destroyed (or goes out of scope with no
   other references to it).

 - atexit() amd rmexit() may now be invoked as functions, or as methods.
   When invoked as methods, they operate on an object for destruction-time
   callbacks. Otherwise they operate on the program for program-exit-time
   callbacks.

 - Added the exit_subs(), is_exiting() and ignore_when_exiting() subroutines
   to replace the use of @AtExit::EXIT_SUBS, $AtExit::EXITING, and
   $AtExit::IGNORE_WHEN_EXITING. Use of these three variables is now
   deprecated in favor of these new subroutines.

   Although atexit & rmexit are still exported (for backward compatibility),
   exit_subs(), is_exiting() and ignore_when_exiting() are NOT exported
   by default.

 - $AtExit::EXITING, $AtExit::IGNORE_WHEN_EXITING, and @AtExit::EXIT_SUBS
   are now merely aliases to a class hash/object.


 04-Sep-1996           Brad Appleton               <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.02
 - Added the rmexit() function to unregister subroutines if desired.
 - Added $EXITING and $IGNORE_WHEN_EXITING variables to control behavior
   of atexit() during exit-processing.
 - Tested and documented the behavior of atexit() during exit-processing.

 02-Sep-1996           Brad Appleton               <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.01
 - Some minor changes to documentation and variable names at the request
   of some comp.lang.perl.modules readers.

 27-Aug-1996           Brad Appleton               <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.00 posted to comp.lang.perl.modules to garner feedback, and
 to see if the module was too trivial to merit placing on CPAN.
 - Added sections to the manpage as recommended by Andrew Langmead.
 - Convert "soft-refs" to subs into "hard-refs" at Andrew's recommendation.
 - Added exit-handler arguments to atexit() at Andrew's recommendation.
 - Changed atexit() to return a sub-ref (instead of nothing).

 26-Aug-1996           Brad Appleton               <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Polished up a bit for production and added documentation. Sent the result
 to Andrew Langmead for his comments and approval.

 Initial version created.
